# PHP

Php has survived all these years because it's simple and beginner friendly.
Folk er skeptisk til PHP, en grunn til dette kan være mengden PHP kode på nett, som er i varierende kvalitet.

## Introduction

### PHP - Hypertext Preprocessor

Php is a widely used open source scripting language, generally used for web development. Php was created by the Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.

### How does PHP work?

Php code is executed on the server, generating html wich is then sent to the client.
Php is easy for newcommers, but it also offers advanced features for more experienced programmers.

### What can PHP do?

- generate dynamic content.
- Create, open, read, delete, write and close files on the server.
- collect form data.
- send and recieve cookies.
- add, delete and modify data in your database.
- control user access.
- encrypt data.

### What is a PHP file?

PHP files can contain:

- text
- html
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PHP code

Php code is executed on the server, and read by the browser as pure html.

### PHP Case Sensitivity

In PHP keywords are not case-sensitive, but variables are.

```php
<?php
$color = "red";
echo "My car is . $color . "<br>"
?>
```
### Rules for Php variables
- a variable name starts with "$" sign, followed by the variable name.
- A variable name must start with a letter or a underscore.

## Php is a loosely typed language

You don't have to tell php what type of data your variable is.

### Php echo and Print
echo and print are more or less the same. they are both used to output data.
- echo has no return value, while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions.
- echo can take multiple parameters, while Print can only take one.
- echo is marginally faster than print.
